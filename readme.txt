# Undulating structures
Supplementary code to the article: "Time-dependent diffusion in undulating structures: Impact on axon diameter estimation"

Contains 5 main branches:
1) Analytical: Analytical predictions
2) Monte Carlo: Monte Carlo simulator of 1D-pathways
3) Gaussian Sampling: Gaussian sampling simulator of 1D-pathways
4) Spectral Analysis: Spectral analysis toolkit that contains also plot functions used in the manuscript
5) adx: ActiveAx implementation (main contributor: Markus Nilsson)

It is available to offer a tool to simulate own 1D pathways, to replot figures from the manuscript and to potentially verify the code.
