# Undulating structures
Supplementary code to the article: "Time-dependent diffusion in undulating structures: Impact on axon diameter estimation"

Contains 5 main branches:
1) Analytical predictions
2) Monte Carlo simulator of 1D-pathways
3) Gaussian sampling simulator of 1D-pathways
4) Spectral analysis toolkit that contains also plot functions
5) ActiveAx implementation (main contributor: Markus Nilsson)

It is there to offer tools to simulate own 1D pathways and also plots figures from the article and also some additional ones from for verification purposes...
